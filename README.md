# Terrawatt Research Playground

This repository contains experiments for building a sustainability research platform using LangGraph and LangChain. The backlog of incremental tasks lives in [`CODEX_TASKS.md`](CODEX_TASKS.md) and is parsed by `task_helper.py` to help prioritize daily work.

Key design references include the architectural blueprint and several research plans stored in this repo. See [`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md) for environment notes and usage instructions.
