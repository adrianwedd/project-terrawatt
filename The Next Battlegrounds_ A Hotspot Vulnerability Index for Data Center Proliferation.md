# **The Next Battlegrounds: A Hotspot Vulnerability Index for Data Center Proliferation**

## **Part I: The New Front Line: AI, Energy, and the Data Center Land Rush**

The proliferation of data centers, accelerated to an unprecedented velocity by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), constitutes a new and formidable challenge to global climate stability and community resilience. This is not an incremental increase in energy demand but a paradigm-shifting surge that threatens to overwhelm electricity grids, lock in decades of new fossil fuel infrastructure, and undermine progress toward a net-zero future.1 The scale of this crisis is expanding at a pace that outstrips both regulatory oversight and public awareness, creating a critical window for strategic intervention. This report defines the scope of the problem, deconstructs its multifaceted environmental footprint, and maps its geographic epicenters to provide a clear foundation for a targeted and impactful campaign.

The industry's growth model reveals a clear geography of externalization. The immense profits of the digital economy are concentrated in a few coastal tech hubs, such as Silicon Valley and Seattle, where the hyperscale companies are headquartered. Simultaneously, the profound environmental and social costs—including grid strain, water depletion, pollution, and land use conflicts—are systematically exported to a growing number of inland and rural communities.2 This spatial disconnect between where economic value is captured and where environmental costs are imposed creates a powerful environmental justice narrative. The industry is profiting by imposing its industrial footprint on host communities that receive only a fraction of the economic benefit while bearing the full weight of the resource and infrastructure burdens.1 This dynamic is the central conflict animating the emerging battlegrounds identified in this analysis.

### **The AI-Driven Demand Shock**

The energy consumption of the world's data centers is on an alarming trajectory. According to a landmark special report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand from data centers is projected to more than double by 2030, reaching approximately 945 terawatt-hours (TWh)—a figure slightly greater than the entire current electricity consumption of Japan.1 Other analyses project an even more rapid escalation, suggesting demand could triple by 2028\.1 This exponential growth is not a continuation of past trends; it is a fundamental disruption driven by a single, powerful catalyst: artificial intelligence.

The IEA identifies AI as the most significant driver of this increase, with electricity demand specifically from AI-optimized data centers projected to more than quadruple by 2030\.1 The computational intensity of AI is orders of magnitude greater than previous forms of data processing. Training a single large AI model, a process now happening continuously at a global scale, can emit more than 284 tonnes of

CO2​ equivalent—the lifetime emissions of nearly five average American cars.1 This distinction is critical: the problem is not simply "more internet"; it is a new, voracious form of computational demand that is rewriting the rules of energy consumption.

This surge is having a tangible impact at national and regional levels, reframing the issue from a niche technology problem to a matter of national energy security and policy. In the United States, data centers are on course to account for almost half of the nation's entire growth in electricity demand between now and 2030\.1 In Virginia, the global epicenter of the data center industry, demand is projected to triple by 2040, placing immense strain on the state's largest utility, Dominion Energy.1 A similar crisis is unfolding in Ireland, another key hub, where data centers consumed an astonishing 21% of all national electricity in 2023\. This figure is projected to climb to 31% by 2027, prompting regulators to halt new grid connections around Dublin to avert blackouts.1

### **The Fossil Fuel Lock-In**

Crucially, this explosion in demand is directly fueling a new wave of fossil fuel dependency. The IEA's report explicitly states that this new demand will be met by a "diverse range of energy sources," with renewables and natural gas set to take the lead due to their cost-competitiveness and availability.1 The speed and scale of the data center build-out is outpacing the development of new renewable energy capacity, forcing utilities and tech companies to turn to natural gas as a so-called "bridge" fuel. Reports from communities on the front lines confirm this trend, with new gas-fired power plants being proposed and built specifically to serve data center campuses.1 This establishes a direct and powerful causal link for a campaign: the launch and popularization of consumer-facing AI tools are leading directly to the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure, creating a carbon lock-in effect that will persist for decades and actively undermine global climate goals.

### **Deconstructing the Full Footprint**

The macro-level energy statistics are staggering, but the environmental impact of the AI boom can also be understood at the micro-level of a single user interaction. Deconstructing the full lifecycle footprint of a data query reveals a multi-faceted environmental cost encompassing not only electricity but also vast quantities of water and the embodied carbon of the physical infrastructure itself.

#### **Energy per Query**

The energy intensity of a generative AI query is significantly higher than that of traditional internet services. A single query to a tool like ChatGPT is estimated to consume approximately 10 times more energy than a standard Google search—roughly 0.0029 kWh versus 0.0003 kWh.1 Other estimates place the consumption at 0.34 Wh per query.1 While these amounts seem small in isolation, they scale to enormous figures when multiplied by the hundreds of millions of queries processed daily. This micro-level data provides a powerful and relatable metric for public communication, directly linking an individual's seemingly innocuous action to the macro-level energy crisis.

#### **Water Consumption: The Hidden Drain**

Perhaps the most overlooked aspect of the data center footprint is its immense water consumption. Data centers require vast quantities of water for cooling their densely packed servers. A single large-scale facility can use between 11 million and 19 million liters of water per day—an amount comparable to the daily water usage of a town of 30,000 to 50,000 people.1 This "hidden drain" is creating a new and intense pressure on water resources, often in regions already facing scarcity.

Corporate sustainability reports, when they disclose water data, reveal the scale of this consumption. Microsoft's global water use surged by 34% between 2021 and 2022, a rise directly linked to its AI development efforts.1 In 2023, Google's data centers consumed a total of 6.1 billion gallons of water, much of it potable.1 In 2021, Meta's data centers withdrew 1.3 billion gallons of water, with over a quarter of that volume sourced from regions experiencing high or extremely high water stress.1 These figures quantify the direct impact of the cloud on a critical and often highly localized resource, setting the stage for significant conflicts over water rights in communities around the world, from the American Southwest to drought-prone regions of Spain.5

#### **Embodied Carbon: The Upfront Cost**

The environmental impact of a data center begins long before it is switched on. The construction of these massive, highly specialized buildings carries a significant "embodied carbon" footprint, which refers to the greenhouse gas emissions generated during the manufacturing, transportation, and assembly of building materials.1 The primary materials, concrete and steel, are among the most carbon-intensive commodities in the world, together accounting for approximately 15% of all global

CO2​ emissions.1

For a typical data center, concrete alone can represent up to 80% of its total embodied carbon.1 This is a critical Scope 3 emission for the tech companies that commission and operate these facilities, yet it is an area that is frequently downplayed or ignored in sustainability reporting, which tends to focus on operational emissions from electricity consumption.1 Ignoring this upfront carbon cost presents an incomplete and misleading picture of the industry's true climate impact.

### **Mapping the Ecosystem of Complicity**

The data center energy crisis is perpetuated by a complex and interconnected ecosystem of corporate actors. Understanding this ecosystem is essential for developing effective campaign strategies. The analysis must move beyond a simplistic "Big Tech" frame to dissect a structured system of demand creation, service provision, and infrastructure development, revealing a chain of complicity where responsibility is systematically diffused.

At the heart of this system are the **"Cloud Trinity"**: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). These companies control the vast majority of the physical infrastructure that powers the digital world.1 Creating the voracious demand for this infrastructure are the

**"AI Architects"** like OpenAI and Anthropic, whose large language models are the engines of the current energy surge.1 Beneath them lies a vast physical ecosystem of companies that own the land, construct the buildings, and supply the materials. This includes

**Data Center Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)** like Digital Realty and Equinix, who are the world's largest data center landlords, and the major **Construction Giants** like Turner Construction and JE Dunn who build the facilities.1 This entire value chain, from AI developer to construction firm, must be held accountable for the cumulative environmental impact.

## **Part II: The Hotspot Vulnerability Index: A Framework for Proactive Campaigning**

To proactively identify the next community battlegrounds, this report develops a composite "Vulnerability Index." This analytical framework moves beyond single-issue analysis to provide a holistic assessment of a community's risk from data center proliferation. It is designed to be a predictive tool, identifying regions where the confluence of environmental stress, infrastructure weakness, and political dynamics creates a high probability of future conflict. The index is built on four pillars, each scored on a 10-point scale, which are then combined to produce an overall vulnerability score. This methodology provides a transparent and rigorous foundation for the report's rankings and strategic recommendations.

The development of this index is predicated on the observation that the most severe conflicts arise from a cascading series of failures. Political decisions to attract investment through generous incentives and lax regulations often create the conditions for future crises. This "regulatory ease" acts as a leading indicator, attracting a wave of development that then strains local grids, depletes water resources, and creates land-use conflicts, ultimately triggering community opposition. By analyzing these factors in concert, the index can identify not only where the next battlegrounds will be, but why they will erupt.

### **Pillar 1: Grid Instability & Carbon Intensity (Score/10)**

This pillar assesses the vulnerability of a region's electricity grid to the massive, concentrated load of new data centers. A high score indicates that development is likely to either lock in fossil fuel generation, destabilize the grid for existing users, or both.

* **Metric 1.1: Carbon Intensity (gCO2​eq/kWh):** This metric measures the baseline cleanliness of the electricity that will power new facilities. Using data from sources like Electricity Maps, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the International Energy Agency (IEA), a score is assigned based on the grams of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted per kilowatt-hour of generation. High-carbon grids, such as those in Virginia (54% gas, 4% coal) or Ohio (natural gas is the primary source, with a carbon intensity of approximately 529 gCO2​eq/kWh), receive a high vulnerability score because new demand directly translates into more fossil fuel combustion.1 In contrast, a grid like Sweden's, with very low carbon intensity (18-39  
  gCO2​eq/kWh), would score lower on this specific metric, though it may be vulnerable in other ways.9  
* **Metric 1.2: Grid Strain & Power Scarcity:** This metric evaluates whether the regional grid has the capacity to handle the new demand. It analyzes utility integrated resource plans (IRPs), reports of power queues, connection moratoria, and projected energy shortfalls. A high score is assigned to regions where utilities are already struggling. The most acute examples include Central Ohio, where utility AEP has a queue of over 50 customers, mostly data centers, requesting over 30,000 MW of power and has been forced to halt new service agreements.3 Similarly, Texas's grid operator, ERCOT, has seen its queue for new large-load connections swell to 136 GW, creating significant reliability risks.11 These situations indicate that data center growth is occurring far faster than the grid can support, creating a direct conflict with all other electricity users.

### **Pillar 2: Water Stress & Scarcity (Score/10)**

This pillar evaluates the conflict potential between data center water consumption and the needs of local communities and ecosystems. A high score indicates development in a region where water is already a scarce and contested resource.

* **Metric 2.1: Baseline Water Stress:** This metric uses data from authoritative sources like the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and national portals like the U.S. Drought Monitor (drought.gov) to score the underlying water availability of a region. Arid and drought-prone regions, such as Arizona, Texas, and large parts of Spain, inherently receive a high score due to the fundamental mismatch between a water-intensive industry and a water-scarce environment.12  
* **Metric 2.2: Documented Water Conflict:** Points are added for regions where data center water use has already become a source of public controversy, media attention, or legal action. This indicates that the abstract risk of water stress has materialized into a tangible political conflict. Key examples include the legal battle Google fought to keep its water consumption secret in The Dalles, Oregon, and the emergence of the activist group "Tu Nube Seca Mi Río" ('Your cloud is drying my river') in Aragon, Spain, which is actively campaigning against Amazon's water withdrawals in a drought-stricken region.1

### **Pillar 3: Community & Land Use Conflict (Score/10)**

This pillar assesses the potential for direct conflict between data center facilities and the communities that host them. It measures both the physical proximity to sensitive areas and the social response to development.

* **Metric 3.1: Proximity to Sensitive Areas:** This metric maps the locations of planned and rumored data center projects against zoning maps and satellite imagery to determine their proximity to residential neighborhoods, schools, hospitals, public parks, and culturally or historically significant lands. Projects proposed near sensitive sites, such as the campus near the Manassas National Battlefield Park in Virginia, receive a high score due to the high potential for direct impacts from noise, traffic, and visual blight.1  
* **Metric 3.2: Emergence of Opposition:** This metric uses a combination of social media scraping, local news tracking, and intelligence from partner organizations like Data Center Watch to identify and score the level of nascent or organized community opposition. A high score is assigned where local activist groups have formed, public officials have voiced concern, or zoning meetings have become contentious. The political pushback against a rushed data center ordinance by Village Planning Committees in Phoenix and the large-scale public opposition to projects in San Marcos, Texas, are clear indicators of a mobilized community and thus a higher vulnerability score.18

### **Pillar 4: Regulatory & Political Climate (Score/10)**

This pillar assesses the degree to which the local and state political environment encourages or enables high-risk data center development. It acts as a predictive indicator of future conflict.

* **Metric 4.1: Favorable Tax Incentives:** This metric analyzes and scores states and regions based on the generosity of their data center-specific tax incentive packages. Jurisdictions that offer substantial abatements, such as the sales and use tax exemptions available in Georgia, Arizona, and Utah, receive a high score.20 These incentives signal a political willingness to prioritize corporate investment over a full accounting of potential public costs and create a powerful lure for developers, often leading to a concentrated rush of projects that overwhelm local infrastructure.  
* **Metric 4.2: Permitting & Zoning Ease:** This metric evaluates the local regulatory landscape for development. It analyzes zoning resolutions, permitting timelines, and the political history of development approvals. Regions with weak or permissive zoning codes (e.g., where data centers are a permitted use-by-right in many zones), a track record of fast-tracking permits for large projects, or a lack of sophisticated local oversight receive a higher vulnerability score.23 This indicates a lower barrier to entry for developers and a higher likelihood of projects proceeding without adequate public scrutiny or mitigation of negative impacts.

## **Part III: The Ranked Hotspots: Top 10 Emerging Battlegrounds**

The application of the Hotspot Vulnerability Index to planned and rumored data center developments across the United States and Europe reveals a clear set of emerging battlegrounds. These ten locations represent the next front line in the fight for responsible technological development, where the industry's unchecked growth is on a collision course with environmental limits and community well-being.

The following ranked list provides a strategic overview, prioritizing targets for campaign intervention. The overall vulnerability score is a composite of the four pillars, highlighting not only *which* communities are most at risk, but *why*. A high score in Grid Vulnerability, for example, points to a campaign focused on utility accountability and fossil fuel lock-in. A high score in Water Vulnerability suggests a narrative centered on resource scarcity and climate justice. This quantitative framework allows for the development of nuanced, targeted campaigns tailored to the specific conditions of each hotspot.

Detailed one-page analytical snapshots for each of these ten locations are provided in the subsequent deep-dive sections of this report.

## **Part IV: In-Depth Analysis: The U.S. Battlegrounds**

This section provides a detailed analysis of the highest-ranked emerging hotspots in the United States. Each profile moves beyond the quantitative scores of the Vulnerability Index to build a compelling narrative case for strategic intervention, identifying the key players, environmental pressures, and political dynamics that define each battleground.

### **1\. Phoenix Metro, Arizona**

**(Mesa, Goodyear, Chandler, Glendale)**

**Overall Vulnerability Score: 31/40 (High)**

The Narrative: A Perfect Storm in the Desert  
The Phoenix metropolitan area represents the most acute emerging conflict zone in the United States. It is a perfect storm of explosive, AI-driven development colliding with the stark realities of a climate-vulnerable desert. The region's aggressive pursuit of tech investment, facilitated by generous tax incentives, has attracted a torrent of hyperscale projects. This land rush is now placing unbearable strain on the two resources Arizona has the least of: water and power. The result is a rapidly escalating political conflict, pitting the boosterism of economic developers against a sophisticated and increasingly organized coalition of residents, local officials, and environmental advocates. This is no longer a fight over a single project but a fundamental battle over the terms of development and the future of a region on the front lines of climate change.  
**Development Pressure:** The scale of development is staggering. Phoenix has become a primary market for hyperscalers, with massive campuses planned or under construction by nearly every major player. Vantage Data Centers is building a 50-acre, 176 MW, five-building campus in Goodyear.25 Aligned Data Centers has broken ground on a 100-acre campus in Glendale, with the first 72 MW building underway.26 EdgeCore Digital Infrastructure is expanding its Mesa campus to over 450 MW, more than doubling its land holdings in the area.27 H5 Data Centers operates a large 180,000-square-foot facility in Chandler, a key enterprise hub.21 This intense concentration of development by major operators like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Apple makes the region a critical node in the global data network and a focal point for environmental risk.5

**Grid Vulnerability (6/10):** While Arizona's grid benefits from significant solar generation, it remains moderately carbon-intensive at approximately 334 gCO2​eq/kWh and is heavily reliant on fossil fuels and nuclear power to meet demand.29 The local utility, Arizona Public Service (APS), is actively working to decarbonize but is simultaneously being tasked with accommodating the massive new load from data centers. APS is building a new 230 kV transmission line specifically to serve the Aligned campus in Glendale, a clear example of public infrastructure being built to subsidize private industrial growth.26 The sheer scale of new power demand—driven by AI workloads that require more powerful chips and energy-intensive cooling—threatens to overwhelm the grid's transition, potentially locking in the need for existing or new gas-fired peaker plants to ensure reliability.5

**Water Vulnerability (9/10):** This is the region's most critical vulnerability. The Phoenix area exists in a state of long-term drought and is dangerously reliant on the over-allocated and shrinking Colorado River.13 In June 2022, the City of Phoenix activated its Drought Management Plan, declaring a Stage 1 Water Alert due to historically low levels in Lakes Mead and Powell.13 Despite this existential threat, data centers continue to be approved, many of which use millions of gallons of water for cooling. While companies publicly tout the use of "air-cooled" designs and closed-loop systems, this is a direct and recent response to intense public scrutiny and acknowledged water scarcity.5 The fact that these designs are now a key marketing point is an admission that a conflict over water exists. Furthermore, many facilities still rely heavily on potable water; in 2023, 78% of the water used by Google's data centers globally was potable.5 The conflict is compounded by a lack of transparency, with Microsoft's water use records in Goodyear, for example, being deemed "proprietary" and shielded from public view.5

**Community & Regulatory Vulnerability (8/10):** The political climate in Phoenix is a flashpoint. While the state offers a highly attractive sales and use tax abatement program for data centers meeting certain investment and job thresholds, the political consensus supporting this growth-at-all-costs model is fracturing.21 In a significant shift, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego has publicly called for an end to these "antiquated" tax incentives and is pushing for a city ordinance to curtail data center zoning.18 This move has been met with organized pushback from the city's own Village Planning Committees, which have criticized the rushed process and demanded more stakeholder input, indicating a sophisticated and engaged opposition that understands the nuances of zoning and development policy.18 The debate is no longer about whether data centers are good or bad, but about who gets to decide the future of the city, making this a prime opportunity for campaign intervention to support local democratic control over resources.

### **2\. Columbus Metro, Ohio**

**(New Albany)**

**Overall Vulnerability Score: 24/40 (High)**

The Narrative: The Grid-Breaker  
Central Ohio, particularly the suburbs around Columbus like New Albany, has emerged as a major data center hub for the Midwest. Lured by affordable land, favorable tax policies, and a strategic geographic location, hyperscalers have flocked to the region. However, this explosive and poorly planned growth has created a looming crisis that defines this battleground: the overwhelming of the regional electricity grid. The situation in Central Ohio serves as a stark case study in how unchecked data center proliferation can capture and break public infrastructure, creating a direct conflict between a single industry and every other ratepayer in the region. The primary vulnerability here is not water or land, but the very stability and carbon-content of the power supply.  
**Development Pressure:** Central Ohio is a key growth market for the Cloud Trinity. AWS, Google, and Meta all have massive hyperscale campuses in the region, particularly centered around New Albany.3 They are joined by major colocation providers like QTS Data Centers, Vantage Data Centers, and Cologix, solidifying the area's status as a top-tier data center market.3 The region's low risk of natural disasters and low-latency access to major East Coast and Midwest markets make it strategically valuable, ensuring that development pressure will continue to intensify.32

**Grid Vulnerability (9/10):** This is the most extreme vulnerability for the region and one of the most acute examples of grid strain in the country. The regional grid, served primarily by American Electric Power (AEP), is highly carbon-intensive, with natural gas as its primary energy source and a carbon intensity of approximately 529 gCO2​eq/kWh.7 This means any new demand is overwhelmingly met by burning fossil fuels. The grid's capacity is being pushed to the breaking point. AEP has a queue of more than 50 customers, overwhelmingly data centers, requesting over 30,000 MW of new power—a demand so large that the utility has been forced to stop signing new service agreements due to capacity constraints.3 This creates a direct resource conflict: the power demanded by this single industry threatens to destabilize the grid for all residential and commercial customers, and will inevitably lead to proposals for massive new fossil fuel power plants and significant rate hikes for the public to subsidize this growth.1

**Water Vulnerability (2/10):** In stark contrast to Arizona, water is not a primary concern in Central Ohio. The region is not currently considered water-stressed, and drought conditions are rare.33 While large-scale data center water consumption is never without impact, it does not represent the same level of existential conflict as it does in arid regions. This makes the grid conflict the clear and central focus for any campaign intervention.

**Community & Regulatory Vulnerability (5/10):** The regulatory environment has been historically favorable to development. Ohio offers a deregulated power market and favorable tax incentives that have attracted the industry.32 Franklin County, which includes Columbus, has a formal zoning resolution in place, but the sheer scale of development suggests that oversight may not be keeping pace with the industry's ambitions.23 While there is not yet widespread, organized community opposition on the scale seen in Arizona or Virginia, the conditions for such a backlash are rapidly forming. The impending grid crisis, the potential for significant electricity rate hikes, and the environmental impact of new power plants are clear and potent catalysts for future community mobilization. This presents a critical opportunity for a campaign to get ahead of the curve, educating the public about the coming rate shock and connecting it directly to the data center boom.

### **3\. Atlanta Metro, Georgia**

**(Douglasville, Lithia Springs, Coweta & Floyd Counties)**

**Overall Vulnerability Score: 24/40 (High)**

The Narrative: The New Frontier, Repeating the Mistakes of the Past  
The Atlanta metropolitan area is the newest frontier in the data center land rush, and it is expanding with a ferocity that threatens to repeat the worst mistakes made in established hubs like Northern Virginia. Fueled by cheap land, abundant water, and a powerful state-level tax incentive, developers are flooding into the region. In 2024, the Atlanta market surpassed Northern Virginia in absorption, with its inventory more than tripling in a single year.35 This explosive growth is characterized by both massive projects from established hyperscalers and highly speculative plays from newcomer developers with no track record. This combination of rapid, speculative development on a carbon-intensive grid, with only nascent community awareness, makes Georgia a critical battleground where early intervention can shape the trajectory of the entire region.  
**Development Pressure:** Atlanta is experiencing a data center building boom of historic proportions. The market had a staggering 2,159 MW under construction at the end of last year.35 Google has had a major presence in Douglas County since 2003 and continues to expand.36 DataBank is building a new campus in Lithia Springs with two facilities, ATL5 and ATL6, designed for high-density AI workloads.37 However, the most alarming trend is the emergence of speculative developers like Atlas Development. This newcomer firm has proposed five massive data center campuses across the state in 2025 alone, including a 2.4 million square foot project in Floyd County and a colossal 4.9 million square foot, $17 billion campus in Coweta County, despite having no prior track record of executing such projects.35 This speculative frenzy is layered on top of major projects from established players like Trammell Crow, which has proposed an 8.1 million square foot campus near Augusta.35

**Grid Vulnerability (7/10):** The grid in Georgia is carbon-intensive, with a supplier mix from Southern Company's Georgia Power resulting in an emissions factor of approximately 365 gCO2​eq/kWh.38 While the state has been adding solar and nuclear capacity, the grid is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The massive and rapid addition of terawatts of new, constant demand from data centers will inevitably increase the state's reliance on natural gas, undermining its decarbonization progress and increasing emissions.

**Water Vulnerability (4/10):** Currently, the Atlanta region is not experiencing significant water stress, and there are no drought-level responses in effect.40 The region's water resources are more abundant than those in the American West. However, the sheer scale of the proposed development, with dozens of massive new facilities all requiring millions of gallons of water per day for cooling, poses a significant future risk. A regional drought, combined with this new, massive industrial demand, could quickly create water use conflicts that do not exist today. Google has made a point of its use of recycled industrial water at its Douglas County facility, a tacit acknowledgment of the importance of water management even in a non-arid region.36

**Community & Regulatory Vulnerability (7/10):** The primary driver of Georgia's boom is its regulatory climate. The state offers a powerful and attractive sales and use tax exemption for high-technology data center equipment, provided companies meet minimum investment and job creation thresholds.20 This incentive creates a strong political and economic motivation to approve projects with minimal friction. Community awareness and opposition appear to be in a nascent stage. The non-profit Science for Georgia has begun to track the "data center invasion," noting that while the state is appealing to developers, "some communities are growing more concerned about the potential downsides".42 This indicates that public consciousness is rising but has not yet translated into the organized political opposition seen in other hotspots. This presents a crucial window of opportunity for a campaign to provide research, resources, and strategic support to empower these emerging community voices before the development pipeline becomes an unstoppable flood.

## **Part V: In-Depth Analysis: The European Battlegrounds**

This section provides a detailed analysis of the highest-ranked emerging hotspots in Europe. The dynamics here are shaped by a unique interplay of national industrial strategies, EU-level regulations like the Energy Efficiency Directive, and the pervasive political narrative of achieving "digital sovereignty." These factors create distinct vulnerabilities and campaign opportunities compared to the U.S. context.

### **1\. Aragon & Madrid, Spain**

**(Zaragoza)**

**Overall Vulnerability Score: 30/40 (High)**

The Narrative: A Collision of "Digital Sovereignty" and Climate Reality  
Spain, particularly the regions of Aragon and Madrid, is being aggressively promoted by both government and industry as a premier data center hub for Southern Europe. Framed as a strategic move to secure Europe's "digital sovereignty" and capture the economic benefits of the AI boom, this push has unlocked billions of euros in investment. However, this ambition is on a direct collision course with Spain's stark climate reality. The country is one of Europe's most water-stressed nations, facing increasing desertification and prolonged droughts. The decision to locate a massive, water-intensive industry in an arid region has ignited fierce local opposition, creating a battleground where the abstract political goal of sovereignty clashes with the tangible, existential need for water.  
**Development Pressure:** The investment flowing into Spain is immense. Microsoft has announced plans to invest €6.69 billion ($7.16 billion) in new data centers in the Aragon region.4 Amazon Web Services is also expanding its Aragon footprint, seeking to increase its water consumption at existing sites by 48% to handle increased cooling needs due to rising global temperatures.6 Madrid is also a major hub, with Siemens recently opening a new data center technology hub to serve the Iberian market, citing the region's growing importance.51 This development is not just from hyperscalers; investment firms like Blackstone are planning an €8 billion data center investment in the country, and subsidiaries of energy companies are also entering the market.4

**Grid Vulnerability (5/10):** Spain's grid is in a rapid transition. In 2024, low-carbon sources made up over 77% of electricity generation, with wind and solar each contributing over 20%.52 This makes the grid significantly cleaner than many U.S. counterparts. The carbon intensity is reported at around 141

gCO2​eq/kWh, a relatively low figure.52 However, natural gas still accounts for over 23% of the mix, and the massive influx of constant, 24/7 data center load could increase reliance on gas for grid stability, especially when wind and solar generation is low. The challenge is less about the baseline carbon intensity and more about whether the pace of renewable build-out can keep up with the explosive new demand.

**Water Vulnerability (10/10):** This is the critical, defining vulnerability for Spain. The country is facing a water crisis, with 75% of its territory at risk of desertification.6 The government of Aragon has recently asked for EU aid to tackle its drought.6 Water losses from aging infrastructure are already high, ranging from 30-50% in most regions.15 Into this crisis comes an industry that requires vast quantities of water for cooling. This has created a direct conflict between data centers and other users, particularly agriculture. Farmers express deep concern that data centers will consume the water needed for their crops, threatening their livelihoods.6 The industry's reliance on water in a drought-stricken region is the central point of contention.

**Community & Regulatory Vulnerability (8/10):** The water crisis has galvanized a potent and articulate opposition movement. The campaign group **Tu Nube Seca Mi Río** ('Your cloud is drying my river') is actively organizing against data center expansion, accusing Amazon of a lack of transparency and of trying to rush through water permit applications undemocratically.6 Their narrative, which directly links the ethereal "cloud" to the drying of local rivers, is powerful and resonant. While the Aragonese government has claimed the impact of data centers on water resources is "imperceptible," this is directly contradicted by local farmers and activists, creating a clear credibility gap for the government and a powerful opening for a campaign.6 The presence of this pre-existing, well-messaged local partner makes Aragon a highly actionable target.

### **2\. Stockholm, Sweden**

**Overall Vulnerability Score: 21/40 (Moderate-High, Nuanced)**

The Narrative: Energy Gentrification \- When a "Clean" Grid Isn't Enough  
Sweden presents a more nuanced and sophisticated type of conflict. With a grid that is nearly 99% low-carbon, the battle here is not about emissions.9 Instead, it is a fight over a finite resource: grid capacity. The arrival of energy-intensive data centers is creating new competition for electricity, forcing local authorities and grid operators to make difficult choices about who gets prioritized access. This has led to a dynamic best described as "energy gentrification," where the needs of new, capital-intensive digital industries risk displacing the needs of existing local industries, public services, and housing development.53 The conflict in Sweden is a harbinger of a future challenge for all regions, even those with clean energy: who gets the power?  
**Development Pressure:** Stockholm and its surrounding areas are attracting significant investment, particularly for AI-focused facilities. The company evroc has purchased land in Arlandastad, near Stockholm, for a flagship hyperscale AI data center, with plans to break ground in 2025 and be operational by 2026\. This single site is designed to accommodate up to 16,000 GPUs, one of the highest densities in Europe.54 This project joins existing presences from Google and Microsoft and a planned €8.7 billion AI data center investment by Brookfield in Strängnäs, highlighting the region's appeal for high-performance computing.54

**Grid Vulnerability (4/10):** On a carbon basis, the grid is one of the cleanest in the world, with an intensity of just 18-39 gCO2​eq/kWh thanks to its dominance by hydropower and nuclear energy.9 However, on a capacity basis, it is highly vulnerable. Certain regions in Sweden have experienced a lack of grid capacity in recent years, forcing other sectors, including industry and electrified public transport, to postpone or cancel expansion plans.53 The arrival of massive new data centers puts additional strain on this already constrained grid. The conflict is not about adding pollution, but about resource allocation. The failure to account for these capacity limitations during the planning phase has created a situation where private data center interests are in direct competition with the public good.53

**Water Vulnerability (5/10):** While Sweden is a water-rich country, it is not immune to emerging water stress. Climate change is creating new challenges, with recurring water scarcity issues in the southeastern part of the country and concerns about the quality of raw water sources due to pollutants.56 The OECD notes that while national water stress is low, regional scarcity is an emerging issue, and the system of water abstraction permits may need review.57 The development of large data centers, while not as critical a threat as in Spain, still adds a new consumptive pressure to a system that is showing signs of strain.

**Community & Regulatory Vulnerability (6/10):** The political and community debate in Sweden is currently more at the policy and academic level than a grassroots movement. The discussion, as framed in academic policy briefs, centers on "energy gentrification" and the failure of the planning process to account for grid limitations, leading to a risk that "private interests supersede the common good".53 While local governments have generally welcomed data centers for their perceived economic benefits, the downstream consequences of grid strain are now becoming apparent.53 The state offers a favorable business climate with investment-friendly policies, but there is no single, powerful tax incentive driving the boom in the same way as in the U.S..58 The opportunity for a campaign here is to take the high-level policy debate about grid capacity and translate it into a broader public conversation about resource justice and democratic planning, asking who should benefit from Sweden's public energy resources.

### **3\. Milan, Italy**

**Overall Vulnerability Score: 20/40 (Moderate)**

The Narrative: The Emerging Southern Hub  
Milan is rapidly emerging as a key data center market in Southern Europe, attracting investment from operators seeking to serve the Italian economy and provide a diverse alternative to the constrained FLAP-D (Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Dublin) markets.59 The Italian government is actively encouraging this development through its "Industria 4.0" plan, which offers attractive tax incentives for digital and innovative investments.60 However, this growth is occurring on a grid that is still heavily reliant on natural gas and in a country with significant, though regionally varied, water infrastructure challenges. The primary vulnerability in Milan is the potential for a carbon-intensive build-out, coupled with a regulatory environment that, while supportive, is still evolving to meet the specific challenges of data centers.  
**Development Pressure:** Milan is a focal point for new investment. Virtus Data Centres has announced plans to build a 70 MW facility on a brownfield site, specifically designed to support AI and hyperscale workloads, with a target completion of 2027\.61 Microsoft has identified Italy as a key market, announcing a $4.8 billion investment in AI and cloud infrastructure enhancement.59 Google and other major players also have a presence, drawn by Milan's status as an economic powerhouse in Southern Europe.62

**Grid Vulnerability (6/10):** Italy's grid presents a mixed picture. In 2024, 49% of its electricity was generated from low-carbon sources, with renewables like hydro, wind, and solar playing a significant role.64 However, the grid is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels, which provide 51% of its power, with natural gas being the dominant source at 38.8%.64 The average carbon intensity is approximately 270

gCO2​eq/kWh, which is moderate but significantly higher than nuclear-heavy grids like France or Sweden.64 The key risk is that a rapid expansion of data centers will increase demand for firm, 24/7 power, which will likely be met by increasing the country's reliance on imported natural gas, thereby increasing emissions and undermining climate targets.

**Water Vulnerability (5/10):** Italy's water situation is paradoxical. It has high water availability overall but also suffers from the highest per capita consumption of drinking water in the EU and significant infrastructure challenges.66 Water leakage from aging networks is a major problem, with losses averaging 42.2% nationally.66 While the Milan region in Lombardy is not currently classified as having high water scarcity, the system's inefficiency and the potential for climate change-induced droughts pose a long-term risk.66 The addition of a new, water-intensive industry will place further strain on a system that is already struggling with inefficiency and requires significant investment.

**Community & Regulatory Vulnerability (6/10):** The Italian government is actively courting investment through its "Industria 4.0" plan, which provides a suite of fiscal incentives, including tax credits for R\&D and "hyper-depreciation" for investments in advanced industrial equipment, which would apply to data centers.60 The regulatory framework for data centers is still developing. While the EU's Energy Efficiency Directive imposes disclosure obligations, there is an expectation that more specific and stringent measures will be proposed in 2025\.68 There is no evidence of widespread, organized community opposition specifically targeting data centers in the Milan area at this time. The primary vulnerability stems from a pro-investment government policy combined with a still-maturing regulatory environment, creating a window for development to proceed before full public and regulatory scrutiny is in place.

## **Part VI: Strategic Recommendations & Campaign Levers**

The preceding analysis reveals a rapidly expanding industry whose environmental and social costs are largely unpriced and unaccounted for. This creates a significant strategic opportunity for a campaign to intervene at a pivotal moment, shaping the trajectory of one of the 21st century's most consequential technologies. The following recommendations translate the analysis into a clear, actionable roadmap, identifying the most vulnerable targets, the most potent leverage points, and the most compelling campaign narratives.

### **Weaponize the "Sovereignty" Narrative**

A key public relations strategy employed by hyperscalers in Europe is the narrative of "digital sovereignty." Companies like Microsoft and Amazon frame their massive infrastructure investments as essential for helping Europe achieve technological independence and control over its own data.75 This is a powerful political message that resonates with governments.

A campaign must counter this narrative by exposing its inherent hypocrisy and reframing the debate around **resource sovereignty**. The analysis shows that achieving "digital sovereignty" through this model requires European communities to cede control over their most vital physical resources: their electricity grids and their water supplies. The case of Aragon, Spain, is the perfect example: the pursuit of a sovereign cloud is leading to the appropriation of scarce water resources from local farmers, undermining the region's food and water sovereignty.6 The campaign message should be clear: true sovereignty is not handing over your power grid to a foreign corporation; it is local communities having democratic control over their own energy and water futures.

### **Connect Local Fights into a Global Movement**

The data center industry operates with a consistent global playbook. The tactics used in Virginia—seeking favorable tax breaks, overwhelming local grids, and downplaying environmental impacts—are now being deployed in Ohio, Georgia, Arizona, and across Europe.1 This provides a powerful opportunity to connect disparate local fights into a unified, global movement.

This report can serve as a critical tool for this effort. By providing it to community groups in emerging hotspots like San Marcos, Texas, or Phoenix, Arizona, a campaign can demonstrate that their struggle is not isolated.18 It shows them that the arguments and challenges they face are part of a systemic pattern of industrial externalization practiced by the world's wealthiest companies. This fosters solidarity, enables knowledge sharing (e.g., sharing successful opposition tactics from one community to another), and amplifies the collective power of these groups, transforming them from isolated "NIMBY" fights into a cohesive movement for corporate accountability.

### **Target the "Regulatory Ease" Trap**

The analysis demonstrates that a favorable regulatory climate—particularly generous, targeted tax incentives—is a powerful predictive indicator of future environmental and social conflict. States like Georgia and Arizona offer these incentives to lure investment, but in doing so, they unleash a wave of development that their infrastructure cannot handle, leading directly to the grid and water crises now unfolding.3

This creates a clear strategic imperative: launch proactive campaigns in states and regions that are *considering* new data center tax incentives. The campaign should use the detailed case studies from this report as cautionary tales. The story of AEP's grid crisis in Ohio can be presented to lawmakers in other states as the predictable, long-term public cost of these "economic development" deals.3 The message is that these incentives are not a free lunch; they are an invitation for future crises, socializing the immense infrastructure costs of the data center boom onto the public while the profits are privatized. The goal is to shut down the pipeline of incentives that fuels irresponsible growth.

### **Amplify the Water-Energy-Land Nexus**

The industry's marketing relies on the image of a clean, weightless, ethereal "cloud." A core campaign task is to shatter this illusion by grounding the cloud in its dirty, resource-intensive physical reality. This requires developing communications materials that visually and narratively connect the full chain of impacts.

Campaigns should create maps, infographics, and short videos that trace the impact of a single data center campus back to its sources. For a project in Arizona, this means showing the data center, then tracing its power lines back to the gas-fired power plant, and its water pipes back to the shrinking Colorado River.5 For a project in Ohio, it means connecting the data center to the strained AEP grid and the potential for ratepayer hikes for every family in the region.3 This approach makes the abstract concept of the cloud's footprint tangible and local, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the water, energy, and land use conflicts it creates.

### **Pressure the Financial Enablers**

The data center boom is financed by a vast pool of global capital, creating a critical set of financial actors who can exert significant leverage over the industry. The campaign should pursue a two-pronged financial strategy.

First, target **institutional investors**. The analysis in the foundational campaign brief shows that large asset managers and pension funds, such as those in the IIGCC and ICCR, are increasingly concerned about the risks of corporate greenwashing and misaligned climate lobbying.1 The evidence of misleading accounting practices (like the use of unbundled RECs) and the contradiction of funding anti-climate trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce provides a powerful basis for engagement.1 The campaign can equip these investors with the specific evidence needed to file shareholder resolutions and pressure the boards of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to adopt more credible climate strategies.

Second, target the **venture capital community's blind spot**. The VC firms fueling the AI boom have a documented knowledge gap regarding the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks of their investments, particularly the massive energy and carbon footprint of their portfolio companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.1 A targeted educational and pressure campaign aimed at major VC firms can address the problem at its source. The goal is to force the integration of meaningful energy and carbon footprint analysis into their investment criteria, compelling the next generation of AI companies to build sustainability into their business models from the ground up, rather than treating it as a public relations afterthought.

## **Part VII: Appendix: Interactive Dashboard Concept**

To provide the strategy team with a dynamic and forward-looking intelligence tool, this report proposes the development of an interactive "Hotspot Vulnerability Dashboard." This tool would operationalize the Vulnerability Index, allowing the team to explore data overlays in real-time and identify new emerging battlegrounds beyond the initial ten analyzed in this report. This transforms the static analysis into a living intelligence asset.

### **Dashboard Layers and Functionality**

* **Base Layer:** A high-resolution map of the United States and Europe.  
* **Data Layers (Toggleable Overlays):**  
  1. **Layer 1: Data Center Developments:** A comprehensive plot of all known, under-construction, and rumored data center projects. Each point would be color-coded by the primary operator (e.g., blue for Amazon, red for Microsoft, yellow for Google, grey for Meta) and clickable to reveal project details, such as planned capacity (MW) and status.83  
  2. **Layer 2: Grid Carbon Intensity:** A color-coded heat map displaying the carbon intensity (gCO2​eq/kWh) of regional electricity grids. The data would be sourced from real-time and historical databases like Electricity Maps and government agencies, allowing for a quick visual assessment of grid cleanliness.7  
  3. **Layer 3: Water Stress:** A heat map overlay showing baseline water stress levels, sourced from the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct tool and national sources like the U.S. Drought Monitor. Regions would be shaded from low to extremely high stress, immediately highlighting development in arid areas.13  
  4. **Layer 4: Protected & Sensitive Areas:** An overlay that plots the boundaries of national and state/provincial parks, designated conservation areas, significant historical sites (like National Battlefields), and major residential zones.  
  5. **Layer 5: Community Opposition:** A layer of clickable pins indicating locations with documented community opposition. Each pin would link to a summary of the conflict and source documents, such as local news articles, activist group websites, or public meeting minutes.6

### **"What-If" Overlay Functionality: Predictive Query Tool**

The dashboard's most powerful feature would be its "what-if" query and filtering tool. This would allow the strategy team to move beyond simply viewing data to actively interrogating it to identify new targets. The user could construct complex queries to find locations that meet multiple vulnerability criteria simultaneously.

**Example Query:** A campaign strategist could use the dashboard to ask:

"Show me all planned **Amazon (AWS)** and **Microsoft (Azure)** data centers (Layer 1\) that are located in regions with **'High'** or **'Extremely High'** water stress (Layer 3\) AND a grid carbon intensity **above 300 gCO2​eq/kWh** (Layer 2\) AND are within **1 mile** of a residential zone (Layer 4)."

The dashboard would then filter all the data points and display only the handful of locations in the world that meet this specific, high-risk profile. This functionality allows the campaign to get ahead of the industry, providing early-warning intelligence to support and empower local community groups in emerging hotspots before projects become entrenched and conflicts escalate. It transforms this report from a snapshot in time into a perpetual engine for proactive campaigning.
