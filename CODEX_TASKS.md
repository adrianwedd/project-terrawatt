title: Nightly data validation action
priority: P1
phase: Ops
category: Enhancement
axis: Reliability
effort: 2
owner_hint: Watchdog
dependencies: [POC-001-009]
rationale: |
  Dragons in the Basement mention data corruption risks. A nightly validation job
  will confirm recent ingestions are complete and flag anomalies early.
steps: |
  - Schedule job after daily ingestion completes.
  - Run checksum comparisons and schema checks.
  - Post summary to Slack channel.
acceptance_criteria: |
  - Validation job runs nightly for three days.
  - Any errors trigger Slack alert.
  - Validation logs stored as artifacts.

title: Integrate code quality tool
priority: P2
phase: R&D
category: Enhancement
axis: TechDebt
effort: 2
owner_hint: Architect
dependencies: [POC-001-003]
rationale: |
  Capability Sagas emphasize maintainability. Adding static analysis checks keeps
  the PoC codebase clean as features rapidly evolve.
steps: |
  - Select linter or static analysis action.
  - Configure thresholds for warnings.
  - Include results in build badges.
acceptance_criteria: |
  - Build fails when quality score drops below threshold.
  - Badge displays latest score on README.
  - Architect signs off on tool configuration.

title: Add open-source license
priority: P0
phase: Governance
category: Governance
axis: Ethics
effort: 1
owner_hint: Catalyst
dependencies: [POC-001-001]
rationale: |
  Origin Story recounts collaboration challenges. A clear license encourages
  external participation and ensures ethical reuse of code.
steps: |
  - Choose appropriate permissive license.
  - Commit LICENSE file to repository.
  - Reference license in README.
acceptance_criteria: |
  - LICENSE file present at repo root.
  - README includes license section.
  - Catalyst confirms compatibility with project goals.

title: Auto-commit processed data artifacts
priority: P3
phase: Ops
category: Enhancement
axis: ProcessDebt
effort: 2
owner_hint: Chronicler
dependencies: [POC-001-009]
rationale: |
  The research plan highlights committing generated data back into the
  repository for full lineage. Chronicler will automate a commit step in the
  workflow so processed CSV or JSON files are versioned alongside code.
steps: |
  - Use an auto-commit GitHub Action after successful ingestion.
  - Attach commit message referencing workflow run ID.
  - Verify committed files appear in pull requests.
acceptance_criteria: |
  - Data artifacts merged automatically with descriptive messages.
  - Repository history links each dataset to a workflow run.
  - Chronicler reviews and signs off on commit automation.

id: POC-001-028
title: Conduct privacy review meeting
priority: P1
phase: Governance
category: Governance
axis: Privacy
effort: 1
owner_hint: Envoy
dependencies: [POC-001-015]
rationale: |
  Before promoting the PoC, Envoy will lead a brief meeting to review privacy
  handling of the anonymized dataset. This ensures community trust aligns with the
  Ethics hearing insights.
steps: |
  - Schedule meeting with Sentinel and Miner participation.
  - Walk through anonymization method and sample logs.
  - Document any action items in repository.
acceptance_criteria: |
  - Meeting notes committed to docs/ directory.
  - Any raised concerns translated into GitHub issues.
  - Envoy signs off that privacy obligations are met.

title: Create FastAPI microservice skeleton
priority: P2
phase: Architecture
category: Enhancement
axis: TechDebt
effort: 3
owner_hint: Architect
dependencies: [POC-001-004]
rationale: |
  The research plan outlines a microservices approach. Architect will start with
  a lightweight FastAPI service to expose ingestion results, ensuring the PoC
  aligns with the planned platform architecture.
steps: |
  - Scaffold FastAPI application with basic routing.
  - Containerize using the existing Docker setup.
  - Expose a simple endpoint returning processed metrics.
acceptance_criteria: |
  - FastAPI container builds and runs in CI.
  - Endpoint returns sample metrics in JSON format.
  - Code reviewed and merged without blocking issues.

id: POC-001-030
title: Build human-in-the-loop validation interface
priority: P2
phase: R&D
category: Enhancement
axis: Ethics
effort: 5
owner_hint: Weaver
dependencies: [POC-001-009]
rationale: |
  The plan stresses HITL checks for low-confidence data. Weaver will prototype a
  simple web form so analysts can approve or correct extracted values before
  they enter the main database.
steps: |
  - Generate a minimal interface with form inputs for flagged records.
  - Store corrections in a separate file committed via POC-001-027.
  - Demonstrate workflow in GitHub Actions using test data.
acceptance_criteria: |
  - Interface available at local URL during test run.
  - Corrections file committed automatically after submission.
  - Analyst confirms the flow with at least one sample record.
